In the absence of strong preferences, default to specialization in the ways that
are most accessible to you.

This is a good heuristic because it leverages the random details of your
circumstances into the possibility of a significant comparative advantage.

I think the world needs more people who are willing to "lean into" the quirks of
their individual circumstances. Diversity and specialization are engines of
scientific progress, economic growth, and artistic expression.

By "leaning into it" you attempt to take advantage of your unique position,
whatever it is.
