Most of the time, when I say "I should be doing more" what I _should_ be saying is
"I should be doing things differently."

It's often assumed that we could always be doing _more_. Exercising more, sleeping
more, working more, reading more&hellip; more, more, more. I'm not convinced that's
true.

There are 24 hours in a day, and we spend each minute of the day doing
_something_. We're never going to be able to fit more than 24 hours of time into a
day. The task left to us is to determine _how_ we're going to use the time we
have.

Why is this distinction important? Psychologically, it can be daunting to think
about adding things to our to-do list without taking anything away. I've found
it's helpful to think about how I should be doing things better rather than how
I should be doing more.

My success rate for behavioral modification improves when I'm able to identify
how existing components of my daily life will be modified or replaced by
something better. Instead of planning to complete a task at a vague
"sometime," I can identify a specific time of day at which I will change my
behavior from what was previously planned. This dramatically increases my
chances of success.

This principle also applies in large organizations and bureaucracies. Better is
superior to more.
