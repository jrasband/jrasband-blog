_Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_ can be thought of as an answer to a
simple question: what is Good?

The answer is something called "Quality."

Quality is a kind of you-know-it-when-you-see-it sort of Goodness that comes
from authentic ways of working, creating, and being. It's the thing that makes
me savor [a homemade PB&amp;J](https:jrasband.com/posts/2024-10-04-the-spiritual-dimension-of-food) just as much as a restaurant cheeseburger. It's the
secret sauce, the mojo, the oomph.

_Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_ is a book for our time. Everywhere I
look I see a dearth of quality. Technological advances have made it so that
every human activity demands less and less of us, so we give less of ourselves
and get less in return.

This was not a satisfying book to read. Its _dramatis personae_ are in pain. It
asks more questions than it answers. However, it was certainly worth my time.
