The single most important factor for success is having self-mastery.

Self-mastery is difficult to teach, but it can be cultivated. The key to
developing self-mastery is to make sure that your brain sends reward signals in
ways that will direct you to achieve your goals.

The main way that I have accomplished this is through deliberate practice. Every
time I want some kind of reward or break, I push myself to work just a little
longer before I reward myself. Then, when I accomplish my goal, the sense of
reward is associated with self-mastery, rather than giving in, thereby
reinforcing a sense of pleasure at delayed gratification.

I'm now at a point where a lot of the pleasure in my day comes from the
knowledge that I have successfully achieved my goals. On nights when I force
myself to do the dishes and finish my homework before I let myself have dessert,
it's the sense of accomplishment that is the bigger reward.

This is a difficult pattern of thought to cultivate. It's taken me almost a
decade to get here. The rewards are enormous, however. The ability to say no to
basically any distraction or temptation in favor of accomplishing my goals has
been of critical importance as I try to balance my many responsibilities and
goals.

As a final note, self-mastery does not have to mean that every waking moment is
spent working or studying. It just means that your decisions are more fully
yours. I have found that self-mastery has actually increased my enjoyment of
leisure activities, because I can engage in them with the knowledge that I have
picked leisure because it is what I want to do, not because it is easy.
