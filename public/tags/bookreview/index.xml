      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&lt;/em&gt; can be thought of as an answer to a&#xA;simple question: what is Good?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answer is something called &amp;ldquo;Quality.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quality is a kind of you-know-it-when-you-see-it sort of Goodness that comes&#xA;from authentic ways of working, creating, and being. It&amp;rsquo;s the thing that makes&#xA;me savor &lt;a href=&#34;https:jrasband.com/posts/2024-10-04-the-spiritual-dimension-of-food&#34;&gt;a homemade PB&amp;amp;J&lt;/a&gt; just as much as a restaurant cheeseburger. It&amp;rsquo;s the&#xA;secret sauce, the mojo, the oomph.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em> can be thought of as an answer to a
simple question: what is Good?</p>
<p>The answer is something called &ldquo;Quality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quality is a kind of you-know-it-when-you-see-it sort of Goodness that comes
from authentic ways of working, creating, and being. It&rsquo;s the thing that makes
me savor <a href="https:jrasband.com/posts/2024-10-04-the-spiritual-dimension-of-food">a homemade PB&amp;J</a> just as much as a restaurant cheeseburger. It&rsquo;s the
secret sauce, the mojo, the oomph.</p>
<p><em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em> is a book for our time. Everywhere I
look I see a dearth of quality. Technological advances have made it so that
every human activity demands less and less of us, so we give less of ourselves
and get less in return.</p>
<p>This was not a satisfying book to read. Its <em>dramatis personae</em> are in pain. It
asks more questions than it answers. However, it was certainly worth my time.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Poor Charlie&amp;rsquo;s Almanac is a collection of talks and essays by Charles Munger,&#xA;who together with Warren Buffett established Berkshire Hathaway as one of the&#xA;greatest investment funds of all time. The talks cover topics from accounting&#xA;practices to the role of psychology in business to general life advice for&#xA;finding happiness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you should read this book:&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s fun to read and has good life advice. This&#xA;book exposes you to the mental models of a highly successful person. For me, the&#xA;biggest takeaway was the framework of &amp;ldquo;mental models&amp;rdquo; itself! I knew about&#xA;mental models, of course, but I had never thought specifically about the idea&#xA;that a collection of mental models of how the world works might serve as a&#xA;general-purpose system for problem-solving and understanding the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Poor Charlie&rsquo;s Almanac is a collection of talks and essays by Charles Munger,
who together with Warren Buffett established Berkshire Hathaway as one of the
greatest investment funds of all time. The talks cover topics from accounting
practices to the role of psychology in business to general life advice for
finding happiness.</p>
<p><strong>Why you should read this book:</strong> It&rsquo;s fun to read and has good life advice. This
book exposes you to the mental models of a highly successful person. For me, the
biggest takeaway was the framework of &ldquo;mental models&rdquo; itself! I knew about
mental models, of course, but I had never thought specifically about the idea
that a collection of mental models of how the world works might serve as a
general-purpose system for problem-solving and understanding the world.</p>
<p><strong>Why you should not read this book:</strong> If you&rsquo;re looking for specific, quantitative,
actionable investment advice, this is not the right book for you. I&rsquo;m sure that
Buffett and Munger have plenty of quantitative ways that they analyze their
investments, but this is not that kind of book. This is a book that gives a
window into the author&rsquo;s philosophy and worldview.</p>
