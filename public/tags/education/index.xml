      <description>&lt;p&gt;In standardized education the primary purpose of an exam is to measure how much&#xA;a student is &amp;ldquo;worth.&amp;rdquo; This is wrong. The primary purpose of an exam should be to&#xA;determine what the student knows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is it that people do with exam grades? They use them to compare students&#xA;against each other, as a way to determine which students are &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo; than other&#xA;students. A grade serves much the same function as a price in a marketplace&amp;mdash;it&#xA;abstracts away all of the details until you have a single number that you can&#xA;use to compare unlike things. Grades are one of the primary metrics for&#xA;determining whether a student will be admitted to a university, admitted to a&#xA;doctoral program, or offered an internship or job.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In standardized education the primary purpose of an exam is to measure how much
a student is &ldquo;worth.&rdquo; This is wrong. The primary purpose of an exam should be to
determine what the student knows.</p>
<p>What is it that people do with exam grades? They use them to compare students
against each other, as a way to determine which students are &ldquo;better&rdquo; than other
students. A grade serves much the same function as a price in a marketplace&mdash;it
abstracts away all of the details until you have a single number that you can
use to compare unlike things. Grades are one of the primary metrics for
determining whether a student will be admitted to a university, admitted to a
doctoral program, or offered an internship or job. The primary purpose of exam
grades is therefore to determine which students are &ldquo;better&rdquo; or &ldquo;worse&rdquo; than
others, because that is how people use grades.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s wrong to abstract away all information about a student&rsquo;s knowledge
until all that is left is a single, crude numeric measure. When a teacher (or a
student) sees a grade, it is an extremely imprecise error signal.</p>
<p>The purpose of teaching is learning, and learning is better served by a precise
error signal, one which gives the student and the teacher feedback about what
the student does know and what the student doesn&rsquo;t know. Exams and grading must
be structured so that they are a measure of knowledge and knowledge gaps. Until
then, exams will be a measure of &ldquo;worth,&rdquo; and students who do poorly on exams
will view themselves as being unworthy or less valuable when they instead should
view themselves as just not knowing something yet.</p>
