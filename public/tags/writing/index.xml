<p>If writing down your ideas always makes them more precise and more complete,
then no one who hasn&rsquo;t written about a topic has fully formed ideas about it.
And someone who never writes has no fully formed ideas about anything
nontrivial.</p>
<p>&mdash;Paul Graham</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that the next phase of my self-education is writing. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>
<p><strong>Writing generates an error signal:</strong> Writing externalizes your thought process,
which makes it easier to reflect on which of your thoughts need to improve.</p>
<p><strong>Writing is a form of retrieval practice:</strong> Retrieval practice is the best
known technique for building and strengthening long-term memory.</p>
<p>These two factors make writing a highly efficient learning technique.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve previously had a hard time writing consistently, I&rsquo;m making a
commitment: for the next month (until October 27th, 2024), I will write one blog
post every day. They probably won&rsquo;t be very long (or very good), but I&rsquo;m going to
write them.</p>
