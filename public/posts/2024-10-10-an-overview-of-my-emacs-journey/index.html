  <p>I&rsquo;ll probably write more about the ways that Emacs (and Org mode) has improved
my life, but here&rsquo;s a brief summary.</p>
<p>I started using Emacs during college after getting introduced to Org mode by my
research mentor. I&rsquo;d just gotten burned by two of my preferred software tools
getting shut down&mdash;one was a text editor, and the other was a productivity
manager, so I was about as receptive as one could be to the idea of open-source
text editors and productivity managers.</p>
<p>Over the next few years, Emacs became an integral part of my writing,
note-taking, and programming workflows. Part of what I enjoyed about Emacs was
how it challenged me to learn more and to become more. Emacs didn&rsquo;t hold my
hand&mdash;it demanded that I learn how to program.</p>
<p>Another key component was the community. Without the abundance of blogs and
forums and YouTube tutorials guiding me at each step of my Emacs path, I
probably would have given up early on. The thing that I loved the most about the
Emacs (and computer science community in general) is that they seemed to be the
kind of people I wanted to be around. They were curious, hard-working, and
clever. They had interesting ideas and interesting taste.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m a committed Emacs user. It&rsquo;s not for everyone, but I love how it&rsquo;s
helped me grow, I love the ideas and communities it&rsquo;s helped me discover, and I
love the sense of ownership and independence that open source brings me.</p>
