  <p><em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em> can be thought of as an answer to a
simple question: what is Good?</p>
<p>The answer is something called &ldquo;Quality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quality is a kind of you-know-it-when-you-see-it sort of Goodness that comes
from authentic ways of working, creating, and being. It&rsquo;s the thing that makes
me savor <a href="https:jrasband.com/posts/2024-10-04-the-spiritual-dimension-of-food">a homemade PB&amp;J</a> just as much as a restaurant cheeseburger. It&rsquo;s the
secret sauce, the mojo, the oomph.</p>
<p><em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em> is a book for our time. Everywhere I
look I see a dearth of quality. Technological advances have made it so that
every human activity demands less and less of us, so we give less of ourselves
and get less in return.</p>
<p>This was not a satisfying book to read. Its <em>dramatis personae</em> are in pain. It
asks more questions than it answers. However, it was certainly worth my time.</p>
