  <p>During medical school, I started using the Anki spaced repetition system to put
large amounts of knowledge into my long-term memory. At first, I used decks made
by other students. Eventually, I found that I preferred creating my own
flashcards over using decks of pre-made flashcards.</p>
<h2 id="focus">Focus</h2>
<p>Making my own flashcards is a significant use of time and effort. At first
blush, that sounds like it&rsquo;s a disadvantage, but it can also be framed as a
benefit. Because there is a non-zero cost to making my flashcards, it
incentivizes me to make the minimum number of flashcards necessary and no more.
I found that before I started making my own cards, I was tempted to download
more decks than I reasonably had time to study. The cost incurred by making my
own cards helps me foucs my energies on just the facts that I want to remember.</p>
<h2 id="ownership">Ownership</h2>
<p>Because I make my own flashcards, I have a deeper sense of accountability for my
study. When I see a &ldquo;bad&rdquo; flashcard (e.g. one that is poorly worded or
ambiguous) I know that it&rsquo;s my fault and I need to fix it. When using a deck
made by someone else, it&rsquo;s easier to ignore the card and keep studying without
improving anything. The knowledge that my flashcards are fully my responsibility
helps me keep iterating and making better and better cards.</p>
<h2 id="schema-construction">Schema construction</h2>
<p>The process of making flashcards helps me construct a schema into which I can
place facts. When I make flashcards, I have to ask myself what the most
important things to know are. As I organize my notes, it encourages me to think
about the relationships between concepts&mdash;how they are similar, how they are
different. By making flashcards, I give myself time to think about the facts I&rsquo;m
studying and how they are related&mdash;something I wouldn&rsquo;t be forced to do if I
were to rely soley on decks made by other people.</p>
