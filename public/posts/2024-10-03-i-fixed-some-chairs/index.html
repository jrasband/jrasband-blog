My wife bought some used chairs yesterday, and she noticed after bringing them

started tightening screws to see if I could fix the problem.
In the process, I discovered that one of the chairs had been put together
incorrectly, with two of the legs having been swapped. Because it
was put together wrong, it was very wobbly and some of the pieces were jammed
together at crooked angles." />

  <p>Today I fixed some chairs and it was the most satisfying thing I did all day.</p>
<p>My wife bought some used chairs yesterday, and she noticed after bringing them
home that they were a little wobbly. This evening, I pulled out my tools and
started tightening screws to see if I could fix the problem.</p>
<p>In the process, I discovered that one of the chairs had been put together
incorrectly, with two of the legs having been swapped. Because it
was put together wrong, it was very wobbly and some of the pieces were jammed
together at crooked angles.</p>
<p>Being able to sit down with a set of tools, diagnose a problem, and make the
world a better place in just half an hour is a wonderful thing to experience. It
wasn&rsquo;t a big fix, but it greatly improves the experience of sitting in those
chairs.</p>
<p>I think everybody needs moments like this. Everyone needs to experience
regularly the satisfaction of problem-solving on a short timescale. Most of the
things I do on a daily basis do not give me immediate rewards, and that makes it
important that I find things that do give me immediate satisfaction&mdash;running,
cooking, and playing with my daughter are examples that come to mind.</p>
