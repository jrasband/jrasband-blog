  <p>Most of the time, when I say &ldquo;I should be doing more&rdquo; what I <em>should</em> be saying is
&ldquo;I should be doing things differently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often assumed that we could always be doing <em>more</em>. Exercising more, sleeping
more, working more, reading more… more, more, more. I&rsquo;m not convinced that&rsquo;s
true.</p>
<p>There are 24 hours in a day, and we spend each minute of the day doing
<em>something</em>. We&rsquo;re never going to be able to fit more than 24 hours of time into a
day. The task left to us is to determine <em>how</em> we&rsquo;re going to use the time we
have.</p>
<p>Why is this distinction important? Psychologically, it can be daunting to think
about adding things to our to-do list without taking anything away. I&rsquo;ve found
it&rsquo;s helpful to think about how I should be doing things better rather than how
I should be doing more.</p>
<p>My success rate for behavioral modification improves when I&rsquo;m able to identify
how existing components of my daily life will be modified or replaced by
something better. Instead of planning to complete a task at a vague
&ldquo;sometime,&rdquo; I can identify a specific time of day at which I will change my
behavior from what was previously planned. This dramatically increases my
chances of success.</p>
<p>This principle also applies in large organizations and bureaucracies. Better is
superior to more.</p>
