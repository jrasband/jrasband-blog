  <p>After I got married, I learned an important lesson: there is a big difference
between differences in taste and differences in values. Differences in taste are
easy to live with and usually easy to compromise on. Differences in values are
basically impossible to come to a satisfactory compromise on. The way you like
your scrambled eggs is a taste. Whether you think it&rsquo;s morally justified to be
eating eggs at all is a value.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between a taste and a value? I think a taste is basically
a personal preference which you recognize is not intrinsically superior to other
preferences. In contrast, a value is something that you believe in because you
view it as being better or more true than other, competing values. Values are
not viewed as a matter of preference, which makes them more difficult to
compromise on.</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s much more difficult to find compromise when there&rsquo;s a difference
of values, a values-centered discussion can be very meaningful and productive.
It&rsquo;s very much possible to have one set of values, yet respect deeply another
person&rsquo;s commitment to a different set of values. Values are also typically not
a choice between right and wrong, but a choice between many good options, one of
which is deemed most important. When you understand someone at the level of
their values, you gain far more insight into their reasoning than if you were to
understand them at a more superficial level.</p>
