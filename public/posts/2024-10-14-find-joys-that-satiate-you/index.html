<meta name="description" content="Some activities are &lsquo;satiating&rsquo;&mdash;when you&rsquo;re done, you don&rsquo;t have an increased

spending most of our time on, in contrast to things that, like potato chips, never
satisfy the desire they were supposed to address in the first place.
Many modern forms of entertainment, such as social media and streaming

than they intend to. To continue the analogy, they wanted to satisfy their
hunger, but instead of eating a meal, they opened up a bag of potato chips." />

  <p>Some activities are &lsquo;satiating&rsquo;&mdash;when you&rsquo;re done, you don&rsquo;t have an increased
desire to do or consume more. Think about a meal that leaves your hunger totally
satisfied. That kind of a pleasure is the kind of pleasure that we ought to be
spending most of our time on, in contrast to things that, like potato chips, never
satisfy the desire they were supposed to address in the first place.</p>
<p>Many modern forms of entertainment, such as social media and streaming
television, don&rsquo;t satiate. As a result, people spend much more time consuming
than they intend to. To continue the analogy, they wanted to satisfy their
hunger, but instead of eating a meal, they opened up a bag of potato chips.</p>
<p>Look at your day and think about the things that you spend time doing. Why do
you do those things? What needs are you trying to fufill? Are those needs being
satiated? As you consciously meet your needs, you will be satiated.</p>
