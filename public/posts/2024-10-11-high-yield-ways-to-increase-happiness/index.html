  <p>The advertising industry usually tries to tell you that if you buy their
product or service, you will be happy.</p>
<p>The problem with this approach to buying happiness is that the increase in
happiness that you get from buying something will usually attenuate after a
short period of time.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are more effective, longer-lasting ways to increase
happiness. They just aren&rsquo;t being marketed to you because there&rsquo;s no money in
them.</p>
<h2 id="decrease-annoyances">Decrease annoyances</h2>
<p>My favorite way to improve life happiness in the long-term is to fix things that
bother me. If you&rsquo;re bothered about twice a week by your gate being stuck when
you want to take out the trash (as I was), it&rsquo;s kind of a no-brainer to take an
hour to diagnose and fix the problem.</p>
<p>This principle can be applied to a wide variety of annoyances. Traffic during a
morning commute. Having to make yourself breakfast every morning. An
inconvenient location for a tool that gets used regularly.</p>
<p>There are probably dozens of inconveniences and frustrations that you deal with
every day, and it&rsquo;s probably worth more than you think to eliminate those daily
annoyances. As you spend less and less of your day being annoyed, you&rsquo;ll be
happier and more productive. Your interpersonal relationships might also
improve, as you&rsquo;ll have more emotional bandwidth for dealing with interpersonal
frictions.</p>
<h2 id="build-in-recurring-pleasures-that-don-t-saturate">Build in recurring pleasures that don&rsquo;t saturate</h2>
<p>Try to find things that you know you can get excited about every day. For me, I
will always get excited about a good meal when I&rsquo;m hungry, so I try to make sure
that my meals can be a regular source of happiness in my day. I do that by
choosing high-quality ingredients and making meals that will make me happy, not
just fill my stomach.</p>
<p>Whatever it is that can make you happy (and not just entertained) every single
time, try to build it into your daily routine. Have a few, regularly-occurring
bright spots you can look forward to each day. It will increase your average
daily happiness in the long run.</p>
<h2 id="think-in-happier-ways">Think in happier ways</h2>
<p>Happiness is a mental and emotional state. One of the most significant, but
difficult things you can do for your happiness is to try to cultivate mental and
emotional habits that facilitate happiness.</p>
<p>This is a complicated topic. It touches on mental illness and the limits of our
ability to control our own thoughts. For now, I think it suffices to say that
it&rsquo;s often possible to change the way that you think in a way that improves your
happiness. There are many frameworks for doing so.</p>
