  <p>Optimize studying for learning, not task completion.</p>
<p>Rote completion of a task is best done by specialization and division of labor.
The classical example of division of labor is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_labour#Adam_Smith">the making of pins</a> &mdash; by dividing
the making of a pin into many simple tasks and assigning a worker to each task,
pins can be made more efficiently than if every worker were to go through all
the steps of making a pin.</p>
<p>In the quest for greater efficiency in my studies, I have fallen into the trap
of specialization of labor. If I&rsquo;ve already watched two or three lectures, I&rsquo;m
in a lecture-watching and note-taking frame of mind. If I&rsquo;m studying with
flashcards, it&rsquo;s easy for me to continue studying with flashcards. When I&rsquo;m &ldquo;in
the zone,&rdquo; the least effortful study task is to continue doing what I&rsquo;m already
doing. This feels more efficient because I&rsquo;m rapidly checking more things off my
to-do list, but it&rsquo;s not the most effective way for me to <em>learn.</em></p>
<p>Learning is not the same as checking tasks off a to-do list. Watching four
lectures instead of one in a single sitting doesn&rsquo;t mean that I&rsquo;ve learned four
times as much. On the contrary, I might experience information overload by
trying to absorb too much information in one sitting.</p>
<p>Learning needs to happen incrementally because new information and memories
decay quickly. Self-testing and reflection shortly after the first exposure help
consolidate ideas for long-term storage. Although task-switching while learning
is less efficient in terms of time used studying in a given day, information
will be better retained.</p>
<p>Learning is the cultivation of an interconnected garden of information and ideas
that live in your brain. Plants don&rsquo;t grow, die, or bear fruit all at once.
Neither do ideas. Effective study requires doing the right study tasks at the
right time, not just as quickly as possible.</p>
