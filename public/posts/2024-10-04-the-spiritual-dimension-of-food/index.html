  <p>I baked a loaf of sourdough bread for the first time this week, which taught me
some lessons about how food affects my sense of identity. My lunch today was
very simple: two slices of sourdough bread with a bit of jam. To me, this plain
meal is at least twice as satisfying as a hamburger from any restaurant. I think
it has to do with something I&rsquo;m calling the &ldquo;spiritual dimension&rdquo; of food. One
could also call it the &ldquo;emotional&rdquo; or &ldquo;intangible&rdquo; dimension of food, but I like
the idea of a meal having a dual nature that feeds both our bodies and our
spirits.</p>
<p>The consumption of food provides us with the nutrients needed for life, but it&rsquo;s
much more than that, like a job is more than just a source of income. Decisions
about what we eat, how we eat, and with whom we eat are important components of
the development of identity.</p>
<p>The spiritual dimension of food is those components of food decisions that
contribute to the nourishment of our spirits &mdash; the intangible parts of who we
are. These are our connections to other people, connections to our environment,
and our knowledge, preferences, and abilities.</p>
<p>For me, the decision to make and eat sourdough was partially motivated by a
desire to be more involved in the food that I eat. By cooking for myself, I take
more responsibility for my nutrition. I am responsible for selecting and
preparing the ingredients. I reduce external dependencies on the (flavor and
price) preferences of other people. Simultaneously, I increase my ability to
provide for other people &mdash; now that I know how to make sourdough bread, I can
(and did) share it with other people. Being more involved in the details of my
life gives me power to modify my life in the ways that I choose.</p>
